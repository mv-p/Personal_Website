My name is Matt Varkony. I am a PhD student at the University of Miami in the Environmental Science and Policy Department. My work incorporates quantitative methods to analyze the relationship between coastal hazards and the surrounding communities. I am currently on leave of absence from the University, working as a National Academies of the Sciences Research Fellow for the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council.
