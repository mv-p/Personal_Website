  My research explores the preparation and response to various coastal hazards using rigorous quantitative methods. My current work includes vulnerability analysis, disaster impact analysis, and the politics of climate adaptation. 
  
  Most of my analysis uses spatial statistics in addition to advanced econometric techniques. I use the programming languages ArcGIS and `R`.
