excerpt: The scarcity of affordable housing in the United States is a pressing challenge for policy makers and affordable housing practitioners. Consequently, intensifying hurricanes due to climate change may further exacerbate this issue by damaging lower cost housing and increasing the regulatory costs associated with new development. My research asks how hurricane damages can affect the affordable housing stock. I use a data set of housing transactions in Miami Dade County from 1978 to 2000 along with block group level incomes in a difference in differences research design to investigate this question. This economic data set is complimented by spatially defined maximum wind intensity measures from Andrew that are used to identify impacted versus non-impacted households. Results from the difference in differences analysis indicate that on average, Andrew's reduction in affordability resulted in about 9000 less affordable home transactions throughout the 8 year post-Andrew period. Additionally, I use the non-parametric difference in differences model known as the changes in changes (CiC) design to check the robustness of these results with different outcome specifications. This non parametric model specification provides insight into the distributional effects of hurricanes that are masked by typical regression analysis. I observe that block groups offering the highest number of affordable housing units prior to the storm experience an increase in the number of affordable home sales following the storm. These results suggest that while hurricanes, on average, reduce the affordability of housing in impacted regions, certain pockets within these regions see an increase in the availability of affordable housing. The CiC analysis presents a more nuanced picture of hurricane impacts implying that hurricane effects have differing impacts throughout the outcome distribution. Areas with high availability of affordable housing that are impacted by hurricanes see an increase in the number of affordable sales relative to non-impacted block groups. These results suggest that hurricanes may act as a natural gentrifying force, presenting challenges for urban planners to create and maintain diverse and accessible coastal communities.
